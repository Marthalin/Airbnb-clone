Situated in a historic property, the home features restored Victorian windows, skylights, and exposed beams. The period details are offset by crisp pastels and modern art. Note for summer guests (Jun-Aug): Some summer days in Montreal can get very hot. This listing has fans and good cross-breeze from windows, but it does not have air conditioning. The apartment is half of a duplex house built in 1874. We live in the other half with our 2 small kids. The apartment has its own address and private entrance. Inside the front door there's a small vestibule for coats and shoes, and a stairwell up to the main floor. The main floor is an open-concept space that includes the kitchen, sun room, dining, and living areas. The sun room opens to a private balcony and fire escape overlooking a courtyard garden below. Upstairs are two cosy bedrooms, each with a queen-size bed, and a bathroom with a clawfoot tub. G",

We'll provide details about where to park when you book.",

One of the most remarkable apartments in the Plateau. Perfectly appointed just 1 block from CARRÉ ST-LOUIS and ST-DENIS, it is surrounded by great cafes, bars, shops and markets. Only 7 blocks from ST-LAURENT and 1.5 blocks from the Sherbrooke metro (subway) station, close to many buses. The apartment has high ceilings, fantastic hardwood floors and an open, bright feel. This 1150 sq ft (105 m2) apartment perfectly blends the character and beauty of a historic area with the modern convenience of a custom-designed kitchen and spa bathroom. *Please note the layout has changed slightly from the photos although the furniture is the same, with the addition of a workspace/desk at the front to enjoy the view! This location is perfect for quick access (by foot, bike, bus or metro) to McGill, UQAM, hospitals, downtown business/shopping se",
    "neighborhood_overview": "The Carre St-Louis area is not only beautiful with its recognizable colourful architecture, but offers both the charm of the Plateau with easy access (on foot, even) to many of the key neighbourhoods of the city and downtown. From reknown French bakeries, cafes and bistros to destination restaurants within a few blocks (Mamie Clafoutis, Cafe Cherrier, L'express, Au Pied de Cochon, Schwartz's Deli) and parks Lafontaine & Jeanne-Mance (Mount Royal), this area is uniquely representative of living in Montreal. Easy access to downtown and the Old Port, but a little quieter, more conveniences & local character.",
    "transit": "Metro: Sherbrooke metro station (orange line) is a 3 minute walk. Berri-UQAM is 10 (orange and green lines). The Old Port is 2-4 metro stops away south on the orange line depending on which part you would like to access. Jean-Talon Market is 5 stops north on the orange line. Bus: The \"Gare Centrale\" bus station is barely 10 minutes walk away, to access long-distance buses and the 747 airport shuttle bus.  Parking: Half of the street and the neighbouring ones is available to non-permit holders. As they are all small one ways, they are fairly easy to find park on (often just opposite the apt), although it is important to note caveats. (Street cleaning, etc.)",

The living room is ample, with exposed brick walls, big windows with some view to the MontRoyal. You are welcome to use all the common areas which consist of the living room, kitchen & bathroom. We'll coordinate to make the key handling as easy as possible. I stay in the second bedroom and I'm away during regular working hours. I love being a host and it makes me happy to help you figure out your visit in the city. This neighborhood is super central. An underground mall 3 min way has a pharmacy, groceries and even a cinema.

    "neighborhood_overview": "This neighborhood is super central. An underground mall 3 min way has a pharmacy, groceries and even a cinema. It is the best spot if you want to have a visit free of driving and even public transportation, because the best way to know this city is by foot or by bicycle! From my place you can walk towards the: -south to the heart of downtown (7min) -west to the McGill Campus (7min) -east to the Plateau, (cafés, nightlife, boutiques, restaurants etc.) (10min) -north to the MontRoyal Park (7 min) -southeast to the heart of music/theatre venues Place des Arts (7min) -south to the Old Port/Vieux Montreal and the St Laurence river (25min) etc. The beauty of this location is that while all the services you need in a city are a few steps away, it does not feel like a busy urban area at all, but more like a charming residential neighbourhood, cooped between the foothills of the MontRoyal and downtown.",
    "transit": "Bicycling and walking and even cross-country skiing during the winter can take you to most interesting places to visit in Montreal.  City bicycles (Bixis) are very accessible for visitors.  The closest metro stations are a 7 min walk (McGill or Place des Arts), but by the time you get there you may be already at your destination! Numerous bus lines are also a couple blocks away in every direction.",
    "house_rules": "Mi casa es su casa\" This is my main home, please treat it as your own. No smoking, even on the balcony please. Building rules ask to be quiet after 11pm."

The space is cozy, not the most spacious but comfortable enough for 4 people to live in.  I don't provide parking.

For unique and delicious places to eat I recommend mile-end and their famous restaurants, coffee shop and bagel shops.  For shopping you'll find St-Catherine Stree which has over 5 malls on a few km and tons of other stores.  If you're interested in hiking, Jeanne-mance Park is the bottom of Mount-Royal and you can start the hike up from the park. The view is beautiful at the top, there's also Lac au Castors close to the observatory at the top of the mountain. It's beautiful and you can have a small paddle boat ride.  If you wanna sight see, you can walk on St-Catherine st towards the East, if you walk until St-Laurent Boulevard and go down you'll arrive on main street of Chinatown. Further down is old Montreal and the furthest down is Old port. If you",
    "transit": "The building doesn't have a lot and I don't own a spot, you'll be responsible for your own parking arrangements.

    "description": "Dream location walking distance from summer festivals and historic Plateau Mont-Royal, McGill metro station, downtown offices and McGill University. Come find the perfect blend of old world charm and modern conveniences! Tastefully furnished in May 2019 with some antiques and some brand new modern pieces. We focus on the details to make your stay comfortable. Beautiful condo full of character located very close to McGill university. Built just before the turn of the twentieth century, this charming condo has a fairly large, partially covered, outdoor space where you can enjoy eating your meals and hosting BBQs in the warmer months. The inside space has beautiful hardwood floods, a fireplace, an upgraded bathroom and kitchen with upscale appliances. Architectural details include a rare curved wall, brick and stone walls, as well as wood covered mantels. It’s truly a beautiful find! The large walk-out patio off the living room is in close proximity to neighbours. Next door neighbour has",
    "neighborhood_overview": "Milton Park (or the “McGill Ghetto”) is a lively, primarily student-occupied, urban neighbourhood. For those hoping to experience life as a Montreal local, it would be hard to pinpoint another Montreal neighbourhood so well located, near festivals, Mont-Royal park and walking paths, McGill university amenities, including gym and pool, and the rich urban life of the Montreal Plateau. Although the condo is fairly well isolated from outside noise, this would not be a suitable space for those looking for a very quiet location. Students sometimes make noise coming home from the bars or throwing parties in the neighbourhood. That said, there is probably less city noise then you might find elsewhere near a main street where you might hear traffic, restaurants or bars. This is primarily a residential neighbourhood.",
    "transit": "Public transportation is easily accessible, with the McGill metro stop a very short walk from the condo. The condo is located right along a rich network of bike paths - pick up a Bixi bike right outside your door! Many of Montreal’s best restaurants and attractions are walking distance from the apartment. Street parking is available, but there are restrictions on when and where to park.",
    "house_rules": "1. Do not use the fireplace. Montreal regulations prohibit the use of wood-burning fireplaces in the city. You will be responsible for any fine or penalty issued by the city during your stay, if you break this rule.  2. No smoking please! 3. The neighbour’s bedroom window is in close proximity to the patio. Please keep outdoor noise at a minimum at night and be respectful of his sleep.  4. Please take garbage and recycling out to the street every week. Garbage day is on Monday. Recycling on Wednesday."

It's equipped with a workspace in each private bedroom, and all the kitchen accessories to make you feel at home. Each room has its own character which will help bring your vacation to the next level. It's located just east of the campus of world-renown McGill University, and south of the mountain for which the city is named. Exploring Montreal from here is an absolute dream. Vintage furniture makes this place pop. Handmade furniture gives it character. An updated kitchen and bathroom quadruple the comfort factor. And bedrooms done in the mellowest of tones means you'll enjoy every second of your stay - whether conscious or not. You'll have access to, well, all of it. It's your home for as long as you want it to be! We'll do our best to greet you upon arrival and show you around - but, if the logistics don't allow for that we'll send out some simple self check-in instructions that will get you",
    "neighborhood_overview": "Two of the main streets in Montreal (Parc and Sherbrooke) are within shouting distance. The open fields at the base of Mont Royal are a five leisurely minute stroll north, and all the shopping and downtown bustle you could want are a five minute walk south. When you stay here, you're in it.",
    "transit": "Buses: the 24 and the 80 are both super close. One runs east/west on Sherbrooke, one runs north south on Parc. Plus metro McGill is a short walk away. Beyond that there is a Bixi stand at the top of the street and of course, Montreal is one of the most walkable cities in the world.",
    "house_rules": "1. If you notice anything that presents a danger that could result in damage to the location or to any individuals, let us know immediately. Genuinely, your safety is our primary concern. 2. Excluding the Airbnb and Tax on Lodging Fee, **for which we play no role**, the price charged includes GST & QST. There will be NO extra charges upon your arrival. If you require a detailed invoice listing these taxes exactly, don't hesitate to ask! 3. Please treat the place as though it were yours. Or better yet, treat it as if you were staying at a dear old aunt's home. An aunt with exceptional taste that is. 4. Please don't use the towels to remove makeup. Please understand that we are not a hotel and damaged furniture and home goods are a major issue for us.  5. That being said, accidents do happen, so please, if there ever is a problem just let us know. Most of the time it's not a big deal and, at the very least, we'll be able to start figuring out any logistics before the arrival of the next"
